GDSC6 invites participants to create a data and AI model for recognizing specific sounds, aiding in the identification and monitoring of insect species in remote habitats. The model aims to improve and expedite the identification process using cost-effective sensors that work day and night. Participants have the opportunity to make a positive impact while enhancing their AI skills and gaining certifications and targeted tutorials related to AI and AWS. #AI4Good is the driving force behind this challenge.
